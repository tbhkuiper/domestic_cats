\section{The First Dometic Cats}

On April 8, 2004, National Geographic News reported that a cat was found buried
with human in a 9500 year old grave in Cyprus\cite{natgeo2004}.  The grave was 
located in the Neolithic village of Shillourokambos.

Based on climate proxy records, JPL scientists Joan Feyman and Alexander 
Ruzmaikin have proposed that agriculture became possible 10,00 years ago when
the world's climate stopped fluctuating and became very steady.  With the
ability to grow and store grains came the need to protect the grain stores from
rodents.
